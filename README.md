# Project-Image-Classifier-Using-Tensorflow

Building on the concept of Neural Networks, we assemble a model on the training and test datasets. Using Machine Learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras, we come up with an image classifier using the MNIST dataset. We test the accuracy and make further predictions. In the process of attaining all this, we perform data analysis and validation techniques.
